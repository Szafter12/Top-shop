# Top shop

Demo E-commerce site created in react and json server. This is the final project of the [zrozumieÄ‡-react.pl](https://zrozumiecreact.pl/) course. Detailed descriptions of the application can be found in the front-end and back-end folders. 
The server is running on a free version of Render so the landing time of the images may be longer.
