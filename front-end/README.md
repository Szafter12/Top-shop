# Frontend

I have mainly focused on the front-end, the back-end is only additional so that I can practice fetching data.
This project has allowed me to gather and consolidate my existing knowledge of react.

## What I used
- React router (loaders, actions, path, children)
- Context (createContext, useContext, context provider)
- useState, useEffect
- Component division
- props drilling (by context)
- fetching data by loaders
- CSS modules
- custom hooks
